#Crypto_price_tracker
we are webscraping the content from the website using beautiful soup and then using tools like numpy and matplotlib to make some analytics on the dataset to analyse the price of cryptocurrencies mostly memecoin :) 
the data is being compiled and displayed as a simple webpage using streamlit
plan to host it later on heroku
